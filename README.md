# Hospital Efficiency Analysis with Power BI

This Power BI project focuses on uncovering opportunities to improve hospital efficiency for HealthStat, a fictitious consulting firm. The analysis is based on a year’s worth of New York state-wide hospital discharge data, specifically for elective hip replacement surgeries. The goal is to leverage Power BI to create a dashboard that provides actionable insights into hospital operations, focusing on factors impacting length of stay (LOS) and associated costs.

Project Highlights:
Efficiency Focus: Healthcare quality metrics span six domains, and this study zeroes in on efficiency—minimizing waste of resources like equipment, time, and energy.
Key Metric (LOS): Length of Stay, a crucial measure of hospital efficiency, is examined in terms of patient demographics, procedure types, complications, and hospital capacity.

Dataset Overview:
A single table with 30 columns, each row representing a unique patient stay.
Data includes attributes such as facility ID, patient age grouping, disposition upon discharge, diagnosis details, severity of illness, and risk of mortality.
No personal health information is included, ensuring data privacy compliance.

Deliverables:
A Power BI dashboard with a logical flow, concise visuals, and essential data for stakeholders to make informed decisions on improving efficiency.
