# 🏥 Hospital Efficiency Analysis with Power BI

This Power BI project was developed to support **HealthStat**, a fictitious healthcare consulting firm, in identifying opportunities to **improve hospital efficiency**. The analysis focuses on elective **hip replacement surgeries** using a year’s worth of discharge data from hospitals across **New York State**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create an interactive dashboard that:
- Evaluates **hospital performance** based on Length of Stay (LOS)
- Identifies inefficiencies related to **resource use, complications, and patient characteristics**
- Empowers healthcare decision-makers with **actionable insights**

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **1 table** | ~30 columns | Each row = **1 patient hospital stay**
- Focused on **elective hip replacement procedures**
- Includes:
  - Hospital identifiers
  - Age groups & discharge disposition
  - Severity of illness
  - Risk of mortality
  - Procedure & diagnosis codes
- No personal health information included (HIPAA-compliant)

---

## 📌 Key Metric: Length of Stay (LOS)

The central performance indicator is **LOS**, a widely used measure of hospital efficiency.  
This metric is analyzed by:
- **Patient demographics**
- **Complications and readmissions**
- **Hospital type and bed capacity**
- **Severity and mortality risk classifications**

---

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- 🎯 **Efficiency-Driven Design**: Rooted in healthcare quality metrics, with a specific focus on reducing resource waste
- 📈 **Interactive Dashboard**: Clear flow with logical sections, filterable by patient and hospital attributes
- 🩺 **Stakeholder Insight**: Built for hospital admins, policy makers, and clinical leaders

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI** for dashboard design and DAX-based metrics  
- **Data visualization best practices** for clean, decision-ready outputs  
- **Exploratory analysis** to uncover high-LOS trends and outliers

## 🧭 Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates how data-driven tools like Power BI can uncover inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. By examining **Length of Stay** through the lens of patient complexity and hospital capacity, stakeholders can pinpoint areas for operational improvement—ultimately leading to **better patient outcomes** and **lower costs**.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **time-series data** for trend monitoring  
- Add **benchmarking across regions or facilities**  
- Implement **predictive analytics** for LOS forecasting and case-mix adjustment
